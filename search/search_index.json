The first time you launch it, the app will prompt you to install Miniconda and set up the Micro-SAM environment. This may take a few minutes\u2014please be patient. Once complete, a window will pop up allowing you to select a tool.</p> <p></p> <p>Under Analysis Tool, choose Napari. The first launch of Napari may also take some time to build.</p> <p>Napari is an interactive interface used in this workflow to generate masks for each cell on DIC images. For detail information, check </p> <p>https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/micro-sam/micro_sam.html#annotation-tools created by Micro-SAM project. They also provide video tutorial.</p> <p>To start:  </p> <p>Open Napari, then click File &gt; Open File (or drag and drop a file) to load a DIC image. Go to Plugins &gt; Segment Anything for Microscopy. Select Annotator 2D (for single files) or Image Series Annotator (for all files in a folder). Use Annotator 2D for this step. It may take a moment to load\u2014this is normal. Ensure your image layer is at the bottom of the layer list. If not, drag it to adjust.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#configuring-embedding-and-segmentation-settings-in-napari","title":"Configuring Embedding and Segmentation Settings in Napari","text":"<p>Once Napari is open and your DIC image is loaded, configure the embedding settings for mask generation. Follow these steps:</p> <p>Click Embedding Settings in the sidebar.  </p> <p>Choose the following options (summarized in the table below):</p> Setting Option Model Size Select <code>base</code> or <code>large</code>. Large offers higher accuracy but is computational-heavy. Base runs faster with acceptable accuracy. An M2 MacBook Air 16G can run large without issues. If you experience crashes with large, switch to base. Custom Weights Path For large, select <code>l_yeast_finetuned.pt</code>. For base, select <code>b_yeast_finetuned.pt</code>. Important: Download these weights from: Google Drive. These custom weights are fine-tuned for Yeast Cell DIC images, offering improved accuracy over default Micro-SAM models. <p></p> <p>After setting the model size and weights, click Compute Embeddings. This process takes a few seconds to complete.  </p> <p>Once embeddings are computed, proceed to Automatic Segmentation Settings, set the configuration as shown, they are proved to be most accurate on the training DIC image in general.</p> Large Base <p>If your options doesn't look like this, please compute embedding first.</p> <p>These settings are optimized for our custom weights (l_yeast_finetuned.pt or b_yeast_finetuned.pt). If you skip loading custom weights, Napari will download the default Micro-SAM model files, which may cause a few minutes of unresponsiveness. To avoid this, always use the provided custom weights.</p> <p>For steps beyond these AutoOutline-specific operations, refer to this tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xjJBg_Bfuc (Annotator 2D tutorial)</p> <p>Once you've done the annotation, you can save the commited_objects layer, this is the mask file generated.
